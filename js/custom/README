This folder contains custom javascript called from the wasm application.
There, they are imported via the #[wasm_bindgen(module = "/js/custom/...")] extern function directives.
Changes in the method signatures must match between the rust and the js file! 
The contents of this folder dont need to be imported in index.html - wasm_bindgen takes care of that at compile time.
